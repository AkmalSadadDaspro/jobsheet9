/* 
1. If the contents of each element of the array num are changed with numbers 5.0, 12867, 
7.5, 2000000. What happens? How can it be like that?  
int[] means every element must be an integer
5.0 and 7.5 are floatingpoint numbers not integers
2. Modify the program code by initializing the array elements at the same time when 
declaring the array
Done
3. Change the statement in step 6 to be like this 
What is the result? How can it be like that?
Done
4.If the condition in the for-loop statement is changed to i <= 4, what is the output of 
the program? Why is the result like that?
error because num 4 is already
5. Commit and push the changes to GitHub
Done
