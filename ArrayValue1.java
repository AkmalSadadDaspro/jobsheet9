/* 
1. Change the statement in step 5 to be like this 
Run the program. Have there been any changes? How can it be like that? 
Done
2. Apa yang dimaksud dengan kondisi i < finalScore.length?
 is the total number of elements in the array finalScore
3. Change the statement in step 6 to be like this, so that the program only displays the 
grades of students who passed, students who have a score > 70
 Done
4. Modify the program so that it displays all students, and mark which one passed, and 
which did not! 
Done
